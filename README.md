## Introduction
This game is set in the fantasy world of Manano, a sort of magical junkyard where spirits meddle with the lives of mortals as they slowly migrate to the spirit world. This causes huge spikes in magic that can alter physical properties of objects, or even mutate people. A few who are particularly adept at controlling magic become potion slingers, and test their skills against others in tournaments.  

You and your opponents must race through the busy marketplace, scrambling for as many items as you can grab on your way there, and then pelt each other with whatever you find! 

Based on Anthony Fasano's PotionSlingers: The Card Game, which was recently fully funded on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/potionslingers/potionslingers)! Check out their official website [here](https://www.potionslingers.com/)!
